An automatic variable is a local variable whichis allocated and deallocated automatically when program flow enters and leaves the variable scope . the scope is the lexical context.
Local data is typically (in most languages) invisible outside the function or lexical context where it is defined. Local data is also invisible and inaccessible to a called function,[note 1] but is not deallocated, coming back in scope as the execution thread returns to the caller.

-local vars can also be define as static 
static  int i=0;

-init happens onceno matter how many times the function is called ,and the value persists between calls

            Forward declarations(I)
Note: your function needs to be declared before you reference it, otherwise the
      compiler doesnt know how to handle the type and/or the return value

1 always explicity

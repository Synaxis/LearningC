// Arrays let us store a set of data types in memory
// Example Declarations

int values[100];
char name[25];

//We can provide initializers to arrays:

int values[4] = {0, 1, 2, 3};
char greeting[5] = {`h´, `e´, `l´, `l´, `o´};
char name[] = {'f', 'r', 'e', 'd'}; // also don't need to specify the size

int bigarray[] = {[0] = 1, [1] = 10, [999] = 0} // here the array will have a range of 0 to 1000,
//and only 999 is gonna have the it's values DEFINED , all the 998 rest is undefined

// Reading from text files

//Options for reading from text files:

// fscanf(): Same as scanf , but the input comes from a file.

//fgetc() : read text file character at a time ( "let use read from a file one character at a time")

//fgets() ; read text file line at a time


//Options for wrtiting to text files:

//fprintf(): just like printf , only output goesto file

// fputc() : write to text file char at a time

//fputs(): write to text file one Line at a time
